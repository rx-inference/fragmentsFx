# fragmentsFx (root) - CHANGELOG

## INFO

This document tracks all significant changes made to the project. The project is oriented along [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (SemVer), which typically uses version numbers in the format "major.minor.patch" to indicate the type of changes made. However, unlike strict SemVer, this project also tracks documentation updates and small improvements as minor version increments to maintain a complete development history.
