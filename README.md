## OVERVIEW

fragmentsFx is a curated library of minimal, self-contained code components called "fragments". These serve as foundational building blocks for modern applications, offering solutions that span the development stackâ€”from UI elements and backend architecture to AI services and utility functions.

The core innovation is its structure, specifically designed to be understood and utilized by AI coding assistants (like Cursor, Copilot, etc.). This allows developers to rapidly assemble complex applications by directing their AI to source and integrate components directly from this library.

## KEY FEATURES

-   **ðŸ¤– AI-navigable:** A central `locator.yaml` file acts as an index, allowing AI assistants to quickly find relevant fragments for a given task.
-   **ðŸ§± Modular & self-contained:** Every fragment resides in its own folder, complete with its own dependencies and readme, ensuring portability and ease of use.
-   **ðŸ§© Polyglot:** Contains fragments in various languages and for different platforms (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Go, C#, web components & more).
-   **ðŸŽ“ Beginner-friendly:** Aimed to provide simple, focused code that is easy to understand, modify, and learn from.

## HOW TO USE

(Work in progress).
